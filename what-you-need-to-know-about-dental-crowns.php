         Dental crowns are a type of dental restoration that covers the entire surface of a tooth. They are used to protect a tooth that has been damaged by decay or injury and to restore its function and appearance. Dental crowns are made from a variety of materials, including porcelain, ceramic, and metal. They are custom-made to fit each individual tooth.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         When considering dental crowns, it is important to consult with a qualified dentist to discuss the best option for your individual needs. Dental crowns can be made from different materials, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Porcelain crowns are natural-looking and durable, but they may not be as strong as metal crowns. Metal crowns are strong and long-lasting, but they may not look as natural as porcelain crowns. Your dentist will help you choose the right material for your dental crown based on your individual needs.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Dental crowns are an important part of restoring a damaged tooth. If you have a tooth that is damaged by decay or injury, talk to your dentist about whether a dental crown is right for you.

          1. What Is A Dental Crown And What Are Its Uses
          <br/>
         </h2>
         <p>
          A dental crown is a restoration that covers the entire surface of a tooth. Dental crowns are custom-made to fit each individual tooth and can be made from a variety of materials, including porcelain, ceramic, and metal. Dental crowns are often used to protect a tooth that has been damaged by decay or injury, and to restore its function and appearance.
         </p>
         <p>
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          There are several reasons why your dentist may recommend a dental crown, including:
         </p>
         <p>
          -To restore a tooth that has been damaged by decay or injury
         </p>
         <p>
          -To protect a tooth that is at risk of becoming damaged
         </p>
         <p>
          -To support a tooth with a large filling
         </p>
         <p>
          -To hold together parts of a cracked tooth
         </p>
         <p>
          -To cover misshapen or discolored teeth
         </p>
         <p>
          -To complete a dental implant
         </p>
         <p>
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          If you think you may need a dental crown, schedule an appointment with your dentist to discuss your treatment options.

          2. What Are The Different Types of Dental Crowns?
          <br/>
         </h2>
         <p>
          There are two main types of dental crowns: Porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) and all-ceramic. PFM crowns are made of metal fused with porcelain, while all-ceramic crowns are made entirely out of ceramic material. All-ceramic crowns are generally more aesthetically pleasing because they can be color matched to your natural teeth. However, PFM crowns tend to be stronger and more durable in the long run.

          What is the difference between a dental bridge and a dental crown?
         </p>
         <p>
          A dental bridge is used to replace one or more missing teeth, while a dental crown is used to cover a tooth that is damaged or decayed. Dental bridges are usually made of PFM or all-ceramic crowns.
         </p>

          3. How Are Dental Crowns Made
          <br/>
         </h2>
         <p>
          Dental crowns are made from a variety of materials, including porcelain, ceramic, and metal. They are custom-made to fit each individual tooth. Dental crowns are typically created in a dental lab, but they can also be made in a dentist's office with a machine called a CEREC.
         </p>
         <p>
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          Dental crowns are used to protect a tooth that has been damaged by decay or injury, and to restore its function and appearance. Dental crowns are usually placed on teeth that have had a root canal, or on teeth that are weak or broken. Dental crowns can also be used for cosmetic purposes, to cover up discolored or misshapen teeth.
         </p>
         <p>
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are considering getting a dental crown, it is important to discuss all of your options with your dentist. Dental crowns are not always the best solution for every situation. Your dentist will be able to help you decide if a dental crown is right for you.
         </p>

          4. What Materials Are Used To Make Dental Crowns
          <br/>
         </h2>
         <p>
          Materials used to make dental crowns typically include porcelain, ceramic, or metal. Dental crowns are custom-made to fit each individual tooth, and they can be made from a variety of different materials. Porcelain and ceramic are both aesthetically pleasing materials that can be matched to the color of your natural teeth. Metal crowns are also available, but they are not as popular due to their less appealing appearance. Your dentist can help you decide which material is right for you based on your individual needs.
         </p>
         <p>

         <h2>
          5. What Are The Steps Involved In Getting A Dental Crown?
          <br/>
         </h2>
         <p>
          If you are in need of a dental crown, your dentist will provide you with specific instructions on what to do before the procedure. Generally, however, you will need to schedule an appointment for a consultation and diagnostic workup. This appointment will include X-rays and a dental exam to determine if you are a candidate for a dental crown.
         </p>
         <p>
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are a candidate, your dentist will create a mold of your teeth that will be used to create your custom dental crown. You will then be scheduled for another appointment to have the crown fitted and bonded to your tooth. In most cases, the entire process from consultation to final fitting takes about two weeks.

        Conclusion:
       </h2>
       <p class="paragraph">
        A dental crown is a tooth-shaped cap that’s placed over a tooth to restore its shape, size, strength and appearance. Crowns are made of different materials depending on their intended use. They can be made of gold, porcelain, alloys or composite resin. Crowns are usually recommended when a tooth has been damaged by decay, fracture or wear. They may also be recommended for teeth that have been discolored or misshapen.
