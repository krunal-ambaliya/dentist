         A smile makeover may be just what you need to boost your confidence and feel better about yourself. A new study shows that people who have cosmetic surgery procedures report higher levels of self-esteem and happiness than those who don’t.
         <br/>
         ‍
         <br/>
         The study, which was conducted by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), surveyed more than 3,000 plastic surgery patients and found that 92 percent were happy with the results of their procedures. In addition, 95 percent said they felt more confident after their surgeries.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         These findings are in line with previous studies that have shown a correlation between improved self-esteem and cosmetic surgery procedures. So if you’re unhappy with your appearance and feeling down about yourself, a smile makeover may be just what you need to turn things around.
