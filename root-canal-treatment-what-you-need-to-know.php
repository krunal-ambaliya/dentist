         <p>
          Root Canal Treatment is a dental procedure used to treat infections in the tooth pulp. The pulp is the soft tissue inside the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels. If the pulp becomes infected, it can cause pain and swell in the tooth. Root canal treatment removes the infected pulp and replaces it with a sealant.
         </p>
         <p>
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          The treatment usually takes two or three visits to the dentist. During the first visit, the dentist will numb the area and remove the infected pulp. The next visit, the dentist will fill and seal the root canal with a sealant. In some cases, a temporary filling may be placed in the tooth until the permanent filling can be put in place.
         </p>
         <p>
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          Root canal treatment is a safe and effective procedure that can save your teeth from being removed. It is important to have any infection in your teeth treated as soon as possible to avoid further damage.

         </p>
         <p>
          - Infection: One of the most common risks associated with root canal treatment is infection. This can occur if bacteria enters the bloodstream from the mouth. Symptoms of an infection include fever, chills, and swollen glands.
         </p>
         <p>
          - Damage to Teeth: Another risk associated with root canal treatment is damage to teeth. This can occur if the root canal is not properly cleaned or if the tooth is not properly sealed after the treatment.
         </p>
         <p>
          - Pain: One of the most common complaints following root canal treatment is pain. This pain can be caused by the infection itself or by damage to the teeth.
         </p>
         <p>
          <br/>
         </p>

        Root canal treatment is a common dental procedure that many people undergo every year. It is often feared because of the myths and misconceptions about it, but when performed by a qualified dentist, it is a safe and relatively painless procedure. The benefits of root canal treatment include restored tooth function and health, avoidance of more serious dental problems down the road, and improved overall oral health. Although there are some risks associated with root canal treatment, they are minimal when compared to the potential consequences of not having the treatment done.
