          <br/>

          Finally, having a comprehensive teeth cleaning on a regular basis is essential for maintaining good oral health. It is recommended that you have a comprehensive teeth cleaning at least twice a year.

         <p>
          How often you should have a comprehensive teeth cleaning really depends on your oral hygiene habits, overall health, and how susceptible you are to dental disease. However, the American Dental Association (ADA) recommends that adults have a comprehensive teeth cleaning at least every two years.

          Dental crowns are a common dental procedure that many people undergo every year. While most people have a positive experience with dental crowns, there are some risks and potential complications associated with the procedure.
         </p>
         <p>
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          One of the risks associated with dental crowns is infection. If the dental crown is not properly fitted or if it becomes loose, bacteria can enter the wound and cause an infection. Infection can also occur if the tooth is not properly cleaned after the dental crown is installed.
         </p>
         <p>
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          Another risk associated with dental crowns is perforation of the sinus cavity. This occurs when the dentist drills too deep and accidentally punctures the sinus cavity. If this occurs, air and bacteria can enter the sinus cavity and cause an infection.
         </p>
         <p>
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          Another potential complication associated with dental crowns is damage to the teeth adjacent to the one that is crowned. If the dentist drills too deep or applies too much pressure when installing the dental crown, he or she can damage the adjacent teeth.
         </p>
         <p>
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          While these are some of the risks and potential complications associated with dental crowns, most people have a positive experience with this procedure. If you are considering getting a dental crown, be sure to talk to your dentist about any concerns you may have.

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph-regular">
             Comprehensive teeth cleaning is necessary because it cleans all of the surfaces of your teeth, removing plaque and tartar that can build up over time. This can help to prevent dental problems such as cavities and gum disease.

             During a comprehensive teeth cleaning, your dentist or dental hygienist will clean all of the surfaces of your teeth. This may include scaling and polishing, which will remove plaque and tartar from your teeth. You may also have x-rays taken to check for any dental problems.

             No, your teeth will not be completely clean after a comprehensive teeth cleaning. However, they will be much cleaner than if you had not gotten the cleaning. You will still need to brush and floss regularly to keep your teeth clean.
